#Simple Blocks Post Type

Creates a new custom post type called Simple Blocks.
The post type can be pulled through using a shortcode
in an post or page. For example:

    [simple_block id="8"]
    
You can pull through a single Simple Block,  or multiple
Simple Blocks by entering additional ids. For example:

    [simple_block id="8, 9, 10"]
    
If no id is given, nothing will display.
